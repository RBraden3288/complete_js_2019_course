    <h1>Coding Challenge 2</h1>
    <h3>Basketball Averages</h3>
    <hr />
    <br />
    John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103
    points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

    <ul>1. Calculate the average score for each team</ul>
    <ul>2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include
        the average score in the output. </ul>
    <ul>3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw
        (the
        same average score)</ul>
    <ul> 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average
        winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one,
        just
        watch the solution, it's no problem :)</ul>
    <ul>5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.</ul>
