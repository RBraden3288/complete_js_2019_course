<h3>Coding Challenge 3</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
</p>

<p>
    To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
    <br />
    <br />
    In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
    <ul>1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</ul>
    <ul>2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</ul>
</p>

<p>
    (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
</p>
