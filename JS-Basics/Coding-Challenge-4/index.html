    <h3>Coding Challenge 4: BMIs with key-value pairs</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same
        functionality with objects and methods.
        <ul>
            1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height
        </ul>
        <ul>
            2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it
            from the method.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective
            BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.
        </ul>

        Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
    </p>
